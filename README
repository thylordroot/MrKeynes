== 2. Compiling ==

If you would like to compile MrKeynes, you will need to obtain three things:

* Java 6 SE
* Maven 3.0
* The Bukkit API

It is important that the Bukkit API is visible to Maven. If you've downloaded
the Bukkit API from Bukkit's git repository, then all you have to do is issue
"mvn clean install". This will automatically ensure that maven is available in your local Maven repository. Otherwise, you will need to issue the 
following command:

$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/path/to/bukkit.jar -DgroupId=org.bukkit \
-DartifactId=bukkit -Dpackaging=jar -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\
-D=generatePom=true 

Now, run the following command:

$ mvn clean package

This will generate a file named target/MrKeynes.jar. This file is your freshly
-minted MrKeynes.plugin. You can follow the instructions below to install it.

Help is always considered valuable and welcome. This is part of the reasony 
why MrKeynes has been released under the GPL. However, you don't have to be
a coder to make meaningful contributions to the MrKeynes project. Writing
documentation, reporting bugs, requesting features, or even just spreading the
word are all ways in which you can help out without any knowledge of 
programming.
